## Part 1 - Documentation###

I'm quite interested in the area of artificial intelligence and distributed computing, as I have taken two intro-level courses last semester. For this class of 2019 summer, CSCI 49XX Open Source Software, I would like to explore some open source projects in those fields. The subject of blockchain and smart contract has been really attracting to me. The hyperledger offers a great community for projects on blockchain: [hyperledger fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) would be a good and challenging project to explore. It is initiated by Digital Asset and IBM, and has been under active development in recent years. Getting to know a project like this would defintely help me to learn more about the mechanism of open source development and project life cycle.

There are lots of novel ideas behind smart contracts: the potential usability runs the gamut from voting to financial transactions. I really look forward to explore this topic, and potentially writing a blockchain network with hyperledger fabric. Along the develepment, I would like to learn something about nodejs and golang, which is used in IBM blockchain. My end goal would be develop a tool tool for community that can utilize the advantages of decentralization.
