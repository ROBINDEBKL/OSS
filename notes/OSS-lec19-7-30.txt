***************Basics***************
Installations
* virtual environment
* native pip
* docker
  docker run -it -p 8888:8888 tensorflow/tensorflow
Practice on Docker
  use python2.7
  sess = tensorflow.Session( ... )
TensorFlow has construction phase and execution phase.
Graph for computation.

Deep learning
* similar to biological nervous system
* train artificial neural network to transofrm an input into a desired output
