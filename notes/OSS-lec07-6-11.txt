PaperCall Capital Region GDG Devfest 2019

Linux
  BSD linux by west coast, UC Berkeley
  TeX is a typesetting system by Donald Knuth - Stanford
  USENET newsgroups and communities formed

UNIX Kernel
  Bill Jolitz(UCB) was developing kernel for i386 under Net/2 (free of the copyright from AT&T) - 386 BSD
  386 BSD evolved into NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD
  Linux Kernel finally evolved into many GNU/Linux distributions

More Open Source Development
  * Apache (widely used WWW server)
  * Perl (bioinformatics)
  * R (origin in AT&T by statistician and data analyst)
  * Mozilla/Firefox (origin Netscape)
  * GNOME/KDE

TO-DO list:
  * get link to chat
  * plan following two weeks
  * lecture review

Open Source Initiative
  Patrick Masson, general manager & dircetor
  promote & protect open source

  open source ~ organic

-> Open source software is software that can be freely used, changed, and shared in modified or unmodified form by anyone.
-> Open source software is distributed with an OSI approved license.

  copyright is supposed to expired

What is a license
  permission from an authority to own or use something.
  grant permisison to use something or allow an activity

Copyleft & permissive license
  Copyleft is a general method for making a profram free, and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program to be free as well.
  A permissive license prescribes minimal requirements about how the software can be used. Such licenses therefore make no guarantee that future generationsof the software will remain free.

Derivative works

Licensing
  foster continued development
  foster distribution of code

Post Open Source

GNU General Public Licensing
Hierarchy of GPL flavors from least restrictive to most restrictive:
1. LGPL - For code libraries licensed under LGPL, you can distribute code that links with the library without making your distribution LGPL provided your code allows for the library code to be replaced in your distribution. Typically, this means linking the LGPL library as a Shared or Dynamic library so that you can replace it without relinking, but there are other options.
2. GPL - Any code that uses GPL code including coe that is only linked to GPL licensed code, must be released as GPL when "distributed" to another person. In this case distributed has the normal meaning -- i.e., you give or sell or otherwise allow someone else to have your code.
3. AGPL - Any code that uses AGPL code including code that is only linked to AGPL licensed code, must be released as AGPL when "distributed" to another person. For AGPL code, the meaning of distributed is broadened to include cases where you give them access to your code on a network node without them actually running the code themselves. This closes the cloud loophole of the GPL.

Derivative work: work based upon one or more preexisting works.
