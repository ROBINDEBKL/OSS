page 5: backend computations
    usually written in C, C++, Fortran
    use extensive well developed/researched library packages
    (access to the repository)
    have experts in specific discipline
    will have support for parallelism
page 6: backend computation
    test the algorithm! before the full fledged implementation.
    multidimensional array and double precision used extensively.
