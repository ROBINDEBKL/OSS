lecture on 7/23, Statiscal Computation and Open Source

Debate over MongoDB / presentation on Friday and next Tuesday

AGPL: composite open source
change the definition of OSI license spirit.
open to redistribution/modification
AWS/...
OSI 9: license must not restrict other software
Users may turn to other cloud services.
SSPL (for public services, either pay license money or release the stack)
vagueness in SSPL (server side public license)
AWS uses DocumentDB (based on old version of MongoDB)
MongoDB is extremely well-known.
COMPLEX ISSUE: making profit

PRO OPINIONS:
1. protect the OS community from the abuse from cloud service vendor
2. make more money to invest into 
   The database software company reported an adjusted loss of 22 cents a share on revenue of $89.4 million.

| Open Source in Statistical Computation |
+----------------------------------------+

Computational paradigms: Map-Reduce (Hadoop - Apache 2.0), cloud storage, and data storage technology.
Story@NY cancer statistics (lung cancer, radioactive scan)
Data needs to be analyzed before further computation.
Some computational principles involve statistical computation (monte carlo)

COmputational languages for statistical computing
SPSS, SAS -> proprietary
R (primarily GPL 2), RStudio (AGPL v3)
SciPy (BSD 3-clause), Panda (BSD)

R and RStudio
* open source
* lots of math and statistical packages available
* integrated IDE
* plotting package
* a large number of data sets available@R
* literate programming - Shiny
Drawback
* new programming language and syntax
* all data are stored in memory
* new strategy has to be adopted if the data does not fit the memory
* R is not a general purpose programming language

Data Science Question
* level 1
  * develop expectation
  * collect data
  * match expectations with data
* level 2
  * stating the question
  * exploratory data analytics
  * model building
  * interpret
  * communicate

Caveat
