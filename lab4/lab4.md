# Open Source Licensing.


#### Step 1
This document has been licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).


#### Step 2
There are four essential freedoms:
1. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
2. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
3. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.


#### Step 3
It is really important to choose a license for any open source project because it would clarify the rights of other people and the ownership of the author. The predefined license is good for everyone in the community. Professor Turner has said that if there is no license in some project, we cannot directly use the source code because it is assumed that all rights are reserved. It will be much easier if some sort of consensus could be reached before any collaborative working. It can save a lot of problems in the following development.


#### Step 4
We should never use a project that does not have an explicit license because we will not get the permission to do anything legally. If the author of some unlicensed code issue a license after you have used his or her own code as an essential part of your project, you may be required to revoke the codes. By not stating any explicit license, it is assumed that all rights are reserved by the author.


#### Step 5
In https://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain, it argues that the Gopher has gone obsolete due to the failure of embracing the model of open source development. I kind of agree with its ideas. They have obeyed the ethics of hackers, especially when the Internet is completely new and in rapid development. Moreover, they were seeking to commercialize Gopher and violating the trust of those who would like to use and tinker with the code by creating an artificial line in the sand between educational and commercial uses. But I think it should not be the sole reason: many unicorns nowadays are not applying open source model, yet still have thriving market. A more important cause of Gopher's failue may be the incohesive and incontinuous development and frequent splitting of the core team. Gopher may be outdated compared to the prosperous HTTPS protocal, and people choosed to forget it.


#### Step 6
Android uses non-copyleft Apache License version 2.0 for most of its source codes. But only the base Android operating system is open source, and most Android devices ship with a substantial amount of proprietary software. Google is mainly in charge of Android development: they release great devices into a competitive marketplace and incorporate the innovations and enhancements into the core platform as the next version. However, Google choosed to develop Android in private: some parts of the next version of Android including the core platform APIs are developed in a private branch. This will allow the deveopers and OEMs to use a single version without tracking unfinished future work just to keep up.
